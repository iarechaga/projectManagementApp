# projectManagementApp
Application to emulate project management with freelance contractors

## Why?

The intention of this project is to showcase how I perform my work and how I evolve the development with small increments.

## How?

I will start with a small application, with a monolithic approach but with a Clean Architecture in mind.

### Why a monolith? 
To reduce the complexity behind microservices communications. 

### Why a clean architecture? 
To reduce coupling and ease the transition to a microservices approach when needed.

The business logic goes first. On each iteration I will decide which infrastructure to use without too much over-engineering.

On the other hand, this will showcase that an infrastructure change won't impact the business logic at all
